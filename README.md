# SRIF

--We provide the source/binary code for 8 multimodal image matching methods in this repo. It also contains the demo code of our new algorithm, i.e., SRIF, which is a scale and rotation invariant algorithm.

--We also provide a multimodal dataset for research, which contains optical-optical, infrared-optical, SAR-optical, depth-optical, map-optical, and day-night pairs.
